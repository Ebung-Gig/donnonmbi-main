                  The Foundationâ€™s grantmaking approach is catalytic, We work
                  with partners to better understand challenges faced by
                  communities where we work to design actionable solutions to
                  address identified needs. Our grantmaking process is
                  two-pronged â€“ Annual and Discretionary Grants.
                </p>

                <strong> Annual Grants </strong>

                <p>
                  This is the primary funding scheme of the Foundation through
                  which grants are awarded once annually after a careful
                  screening process by Management and the Board of Trustees.
                  Every year, a Call for Concept Notes is published, requesting
                  qualified organisations based in Nigeria to apply for funds to
                  implement projects in the Foundationâ€™s focus areas of Health
                  and Education.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Foundationâ€™s annual grantmaking process is split into main
                  grants and community funds.
                </p>
                <strong> Main Grants </strong>
                <p>
                  The Foundation supports initiatives across Nigeria by inviting
                  NGOs to apply for funding to implement projects within its
                  focus areas of Health and Education. Interventions under this
                  grant can be implemented in any state in Nigeria.
                </p>
                <strong> Community Funds </strong>
                <p>
                  Taraba and Edo states are the home states of the founderâ€™s
                  family. As a result, the Foundation annually supports special
                  initiatives to be implemented in these states through its
                  community fund schemes for grassroot organisations based and
                  working in these states. The Taraba Community Fund was
                  launched in February 2011, while the Edo Community Fund was
                  launched in February 2012. The Community fund brings funding
                  closer to the communities and makes it possible for less
                  formally constituted organisations to receive support.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Community Fund provides small grants to small NGOs and
                  CBOs to carry out innovative development activities geared
                  towards addressing the social-economic challenges within rural
                  communities. It also provides technical and institutional
                  assistance as a way of addressing organisational development
                  and enhancing community engagement in targeted social
                  initiatives. Interventions under this grant can only be
                  implemented in Taraba and Edo States by organisations
                  registered and based there.
                </p>
                <strong> Discretionary Grants </strong>
                <p>
                  The Grant is administered all year-round to facilitate rapid
                  response to people facing humanitarian emergencies in Nigeria
                  and for interventions determined to be within the Foundationâ€™s
                  focus areas.
